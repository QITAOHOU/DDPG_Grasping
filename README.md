# Deep Reinforcement Learning for robotic manuplation

Tensorflow implementation of DDPG for our manuplation system  

**A WIP Repo**

This implementation contains:

1. DDPG with input of image  
2. Experience replay memory  
    - to reduce the correlations between consecutive updates  
3. V-Rep simulation for robotic grasping
